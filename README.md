# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about)

Hi! And welcome to my advent of code project! Here you can find all my solutions for the AOC puzzels.

I use advent of code to compete with coworkers and friends, to see which one of use can produce the most efficient or
the most pretty looking code, but also to learn new languages!

Feel free to take a look around and judge my code :smiling_imp:

## [AOC Commons](aoc-commons)

Made in Kotlin. Used to find day classes and load input files for Java/Kotlin projects.
